intro-p: For the inaugural Queer Capital Cup, the Ottawa Otters needed a new graphic to promote their tournament. After the logo was chosen, the project grew to include a fully branded social media package and motion assets, to really elevate the online experience leading up to, and during, the weekend.

inspiration-img-alt: Image along the Ottawa Rideau Canal near Laurier Avenue Bridge in winter, with skaters on the ice.
p-inspo: The Otters team wanted a logo that clearly represented Ottawa, but wasn't just generic imagery of the Parliament buildings. When considering alternate options, the iconic Rideau Canal seemed a great option to represent the city, while also making the connection to ice skating. A distant view of the Laurier Avenue Bridge makes up the main shape of the graphic.

p-compo-1: The Otters have a fabulous logo established, and I wanted to make sure to use the same colouring in the tournament logo. To stay within their established brand style, I reproduced versions of the logo otter and this other existing otter image for my new illustrations and motion pieces.
p-compo-2: The logo uses an altered version of the font Lato, as do the general tournament graphics. The themes present throughout the imagery used are a mixture of Ottawa imagery, pride imagery, hockey imagery, and otters!

  p-extra-1: As part of their full social package, I suggested using GIPHY to host some of the animations the team was interested in seeing. That way they could get social engagement from players during (and after!) the tournament. Look them up on GIPHY with the search term "Ottawa Otters"!
  p-extra-2: Once we got talking about animated otters and fun ideas for what they could do, the team asked about revealing the logo on instagram with an animation of an otter shooting a puck towards the viewer, before the logo comes into view. I was only too happy to oblige.

inspiration-img-alt: Image along the Ottawa Rideau Canal near Laurier Avenue Bridge in winter, with skaters on the ice.
p-inspo: The Otters team wanted a logo that clearly represented Ottawa, but wasn't just imagery of the Parliament buildings. When considering alternate options, the iconic Rideau Canal seemed a great option to also promote the connection to ice skating. A distant view of the Laurier Avenue Bridge makes up the main shape of the graphic.

intro-p: As a personal project, I decided to create my own illustrated version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as a way to explore the articles in more depth, but also to make the information more accessible for others. The information contained is relevant to everybody, especially for those who still have to fight for these rights to be honoured in their lives and countries. Create an illustrated guide book detailing the thirty articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for quick reference at home, work or in study.

  When starting this project I knew I wanted to establish a serious tone, since the inherent human rights described in this document are unfortunately not yet available for all people, as of the completion of this project. I came across this image of a raised fist in black and white, which I quickly began to imagine with sketched on elements, helping me develop the overall look of how the articles are represented in this document.
compo-img-1: compo-unudhr-1.png
compo-img-1-alt: A sample of the fonts Proxima Nova, Freight Text Pro, and Samantha, as well as three CMYK swatches, 70 36 0 0, 94 73 35 21, and 86 57 0 16.
compo-img-2: compo-unudhr-2.png
compo-img-2-alt: An colour image of several hands lined up, with arrows pointing to a black and white version of the same image outlined in white pencil lines.
p-compo-1: Proxima Nova and Freight Text Pro were chosen for clarity and because they are complimentary to each other. Samantha provided an elegant and readable font for accent copy. The only colours used are shades of the blue used in the UN logo, the exact shade of which is on the above left.
p-compo-2: Each article image is in greyscale with white, sketched on elements. The goal was to keep the images as generic as possible, not showing faces, to communicate that the content is not for one group of people, but rather is representative of all people.

  extra-heading: Providing for a Missing Demographic
  extra-img-1: unudhr-extra-1.jpg
  extra-img-1-alt: An image of the original UN UDHR document, some of the text, and the cover of the illustrated version.
  extra-img-2: unudhr-extra-2.jpg
  extra-img-2-alt: Illustration of a person bursting from an egg, the text of UDHR article one, and an illustration of two pairs of adult hands holding baby feet with a heart drawn on.
  p-extra-1: The full content of the UNDR, as well as the background information contained in my document, can be found on the United Nations website. There is an image of the official document drafted in 1948, and a PDF file of the text content. There is also an illustrated version on the site.
  p-extra-2: The illustrated version available is targeting a younger demographic. This is great, but it leaves a gap for users who are older but perhaps might still appreciate visuals to help contextualize some of the legal jargon in the document. My version is targeted towards an older demographic in tone, which covers a missing component of the available resources.

intro-p: As a personal project, I decided to create my own illustrated version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as a way to explore the articles in more depth, but also to make the information more accessible for others. The information contained is relevant to everybody, and especially now.
client: United Nations (Personal Project)
goal: Create an illustrated guide book detailing the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for quick reference at home, work or in study.

intro-p: When tasked with choosing a small business logo to update, I knew I wanted to connect with a non-profit if possible, because I am interested in contributing to such organizations whenever I am able. 613 Flea is not only an organization that fits these requirements, but is also an event I have attended and enjoyed personally. Taking this project on was an exciting prospect.
client: Camp Fortune
goal: Create a campaign design that will cover various advertising opportunities (print, web) and attract viewers to purchase a season pass at Camp Fortune.
other-heading: "Favourite Detail:"
other: Character art style of the ill-fated skiers.

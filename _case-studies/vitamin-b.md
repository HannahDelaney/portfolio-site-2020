intro-p: As a project in my web development class, I was tasked with designing and building an ecommerce site selling whatever I wished to. I invented a honey business because I was interested in the style of branding I could create to accompany it.
client: Vitamin Bee Honey
goal: Develop a branded style for the company and site, as well as a pattern library for the client to pull assets from. The designs should retain a whimsical vibe but be easy to navigate for users of various ages.

p-1: Vitamin Bee is a small family-run business, with a focus on honey and beeswax products. The design is pleasant and warm, with a limited colour palette so as to not distract or complicate the process of getting information, or finding the items desired for purchase.

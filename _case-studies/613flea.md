intro-p: When tasked with choosing a small business logo to update, I knew I wanted to connect with a non-profit if possible, because I am interested in contributing to such organizations whenever I am able. 613 Flea is not only an organization that fits these requirements, but is also an event I have attended and enjoyed personally. Taking this project on was an exciting prospect.
client: 613 Flea, Ottawaâ€™s free monthly marketplace
goal: Design a fresh logo for the popular event/organization, that will be familiar and representative of all attendees and vendors.
other-heading: "Favourite Detail:"
other: The heart, from the original logo, is still present in the new one.

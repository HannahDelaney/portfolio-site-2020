intro-p: Each year, the Canadian chapter of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF-Canada) funs a campaign to sell true-to-life plush toys and apparel, proceeds of which go towards preserving the real world habitats of the animals featured. Working with product I've enjoyed on a personal level, an iconic brand, and getting to work on something charitable, are three ingredients for my kind of project!

p-inspo: One of our early project goals was to emphasize the "true-to-life" features of the plush. The original idea was to show home scenarios, with a reflection of a real animal to show just how accurate the toys are. This concept was eventually altered to focus primarily on the plush in real world home environments, to tie into the "Bring Wildlife Home" tagline the writing team settled on. My focus among a team of designers was to create the imagery of the plush in these environments, digital assets, and all animated media.

p-compo-1: Once we had a tagline, the font Source Serif 4 was chosen to bring it to life. An array of natural colours were used across the assets, to align with the animal's individual habitats.
p-compo-2: As an educational resource, WWF-Canada always depict animals in a scientifically accurate way, and illustrations were no exception to this! For each animal, considerations were made on what plants could be found in their habitat, and added to an ever growing library of options.

  p-extra-1: The scale of this campaign required out of home (OOH) assets. Traditional and digital billboards, as well as smaller format screens with custom QR codes were used, to direct viewers towards the online shop.
  p-extra-2: Programmatic ads were used to further the reach of the campaign online. The team produced assets for more than fifteen different targetted marketing media buy companies, and more than ten OOH environments. As the sole motion designer on this project, I was kept very busy!

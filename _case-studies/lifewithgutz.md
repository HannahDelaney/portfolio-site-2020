intro-p: I was thrilled when I got the first email about this project. The client, Katie, approached me in need of a site to accompany the launch of her online presence and YouTube channel. She needed a site that would function as a blog and collect email subscribers, with the potential to grow along with her community.
client: Life with Gutz
goal: Design and develop a responsive online platform for a woman setting up a blog for her personal brand, using Netlify as a CMS.

  After learning the needs for this site, I realized early on that the best option was to have a me code and design the entire site rather than use a web design service, then set up a CMS (Content Management System) through Netlify. This way she could easily add more content that would work within what I would build for her, and I would have full control of the design. Having such freedom, and having my first client for a job of this scale, was very exciting.

  Katie already had a logo for herself, and was interested in using the colours orange and purple, as they are incorporated in a portrait of herself she also already had. As I considered the sort of content she is putting out, which involves fire and flow and telling stories, I started to imagine the flowing purple shapes that are now a key visual element of the site. I wanted her site to feel polished, but also represent her content and personality.
